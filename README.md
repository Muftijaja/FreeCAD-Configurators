# FreeCAD Configurators

FreeCAD Configurators are parametric 3D models made in FreeCAD that have a set of user-modifiable predefined parameters.

## Why use FreeCAD Configurators

![](images/freecad-simple-example.png)

FreeCAD Confugurators allow you to quickly generate 3D models with similar attributes but different values of those attributes. CAD Configurators are generally used to capture the knowledge of products, parts and 3d models and to accelerate the development in mechanical engineering.

## Getting Started

To use a configurator you open it in FreeCAD, open the Spreadsheet "specification" and set the predefined parameters to your desired value. Not all combinations of parameter values are valid to rebuild the model without problems. After setting the desired parameter values the updated 3D model can be examined in the 3D View of FreeCAD. 

**Hint:** With the function window -> arrange in the FreeCAD menu the 3D model and the Spreadsheet can be viewed simultaneously

At last but not least the 3D model can be exported as a STEP file to use it in other applications.

### Prerequisites

In order to run these configurators you need to have installed the latest stable version of FreeCAD, but at least version 0.18.4
